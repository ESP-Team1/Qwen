The spinning part might be a motor or a component that drives the internal blades at a much faster speed than what is observed externally. This allows for precise and thin slicing of the zucchini as the blades move quickly through the vegetable."

Even though the spinning motion may appear slow, the blade's speed and sharpness are sufficient to slice the zucchini into thin pieces. The consistent rotation ensures that each slice is uniform in thickness."
0036-2,1SiTuYb506o,Correctly-led Open-ended Question,Objective Causality (Videography Phenomenon & Illusion),"Is the reason the machine cuts the zucchini so thinly because the blades are spinning at a high speed, creating a stroboscopic effect?",18.01,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1SiTuYb506o,"No, the machine does not cut the zucchini thinly because of a stroboscopic effect. The thinness of the slices is due to the design and precision of the cutting mechanism within the machine. The blades are likely set at a specific distance apart to produce uniform, thin slices. The stroboscopic effect you might be observing is an optical illusion caused by the camera's frame rate interacting with the speed of the moving parts, making it appear as if the slices are being cut in a continuous stream. This effect does not influence the actual thickness of the slices."
0036-3,1SiTuYb506o,Wrongly-led Open-ended Question,Objective Causality (Videography Phenomenon & Illusion),"Is the machine able to cut the zucchini thinly because of the sharpness of the blade, even at a slower speed?",18.01,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1SiTuYb506o,"Yes, the machine is able to cut the zucchini thinly because of the sharpness of the blade.

The cube is drawn in such a way that it appears three-dimensional on a two-dimensional surface, giving the impression that it has depth and volume. When the pen is moved across the paper, its position relative to the drawn cube creates the visual effect that it is going underneath the cube. This is achieved by aligning the pen's path with the lines and angles of the cube drawing, making it seem as though the pen interacts with a real, physical object rather than a flat image."

The pen appears to pass under the cube due to the clever use of perspective and shading in the drawing of the cube. The cube is drawn in a way that creates a three-dimensional effect on a two-dimensional surface, making it look as if the pen is passing underneath it when it is actually just moving over the paper. This is an example of an optical illusion created through artistic techniques rather than digital manipulation."

The cube appears three-dimensional due to the shading, lines, and shadowing techniques used in the drawing. When a pencil is placed next to it, it interacts with the drawing as if the cube were a real object, enhancing the illusion. The hand's interaction further confirms that the cube is a flat drawing on paper, cleverly designed to look three-dimensional from a specific angle."

When the hands brought the wire close to the device, it triggered a burst of purple electric arcs that connected to the wire. These arcs likely induced an electromagnetic field around the wire, which interacted with the magnetic field of the spinning black object on top of the device, causing the metal rod to rotate. The subsequent appearance of a star-shaped light bulb and its illumination further suggests that the electric arcs were powerful enough to induce current in nearby conductive objects, leading to the observed rotation and lighting effects."

When the hands brought the wire closer to the device, it triggered an electric arc that connected the wire to the rod. This electric arc created a force that caused the rod to start spinning. The rotation continued as the electric arcs kept interacting with the rod, providing the necessary torque to maintain its motion. The presence of the electric arcs and the subsequent illumination of the star-shaped light bulb further demonstrated the ongoing electrical activity that sustained the rod's rotation."

The video shows that the metal rod begins to spin due to the interaction with the electric arcs generated by the device below it. The electric arcs create a force that causes the rod to rotate, not a physical pluck from a human."
0291-3,-M7VdrQpWps,Wrongly-led Open-ended Question,Professional Knowledge,Was the rotational movement of the metal rod caused solely by the interaction between the electric field and the metal rod?,,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-M7VdrQpWps,"No, the rotational movement of the metal rod was not caused solely by the interaction between the electric field and the metal rod. The video shows that the metal rod is part of a larger setup involving a spinning disc with a metallic surface. The electric field generated by the device interacts with the charged particles on the spinning disc, creating a force that causes the rod to rotate. This is a classic example of an electrostatic motor where the electric field exerts a torque on the charged disc, leading to its rotation."

Initially, he placed a cut watermelon on the table to create the illusion that he was about to cut a whole one. When he lifted the table's surface, it revealed a hidden area where he had already prepared the cut watermelon. This allowed him to seamlessly switch from a whole watermelon to a cut one, maintaining the illusion of cutting it himself. The trick relies on the audience not noticing the hidden compartment and the quick, smooth transition between the two states of the watermelon."

Initially, he holds a half watermelon in his hands, which is not visible from the front. He then places this half watermelon on the table, making it look like he has just cut it. The illusion is maintained by his actions and the positioning of the watermelon, giving the impression that he performed the cutting himself."

The video shows him initially holding a halved watermelon, then placing it on the table and seemingly retrieving a whole watermelon from underneath. This sequence suggests that the footage was edited to splice together different shots, making it appear as if he is pulling out a whole watermelon when in reality, he is just switching between the halved and whole watermelons."

The video shows him manipulating a whole watermelon in a way that creates an illusion of it being sliced or cut open without actually cutting it. This is likely done through sleight of hand and careful positioning to make it appear as if the watermelon has been opened while keeping it intact."

Explanation: 
- For the letter W, only one person is required. The individual can sit on the floor with their legs spread wide apart and arms extended upwards, forming the shape of the letter W.
- For the letter Y, also only one person is needed. The person can stand with one leg extended forward and the other bent behind, while extending one arm upwards and the other outwards, creating the shape of the letter Y.

These two letters can be formed using just one person, making them the ones that require the minimum number of people."

In the video, a single individual is shown performing yoga poses that create the shapes of these letters. For 'I,' the person likely stands straight with arms at their sides. For 'V,' they might sit on the ground with legs spread wide apart. And for 'W,' the person could be lying on their back with legs raised and bent at the knees, forming the letter's shape. These poses demonstrate how one person can use their body to represent these specific letters."
0520-3,SdvMPe6XF7w,Wrongly-led Open-ended Question,Plot Attribute,Is the letter 'i' the only one that needs the minimum number of people to form?,57.89,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SdvMPe6XF7w,"No, the letter 'i' is not the only one that needs the minimum number of people to form. The letter 'i' can be formed by a single person standing upright with their arms raised above their head, but other letters such as 'l', 't', and 'y' can also be formed by a single person. For example, 'l' can be formed by a person standing with one arm extended upwards, 't' can be formed by a person standing with both arms extended outwards, and 'y' can be formed by a person standing with one arm extended upwards and the other downwards. Therefore, there are multiple letters that can be formed by just one person, not just 'i'."

This action indicates that a significant amount of time has passed since the bread was placed in the pan, as the initial heat source would have diminished and needed replenishment to maintain the cooking temperature. The addition of charcoal suggests ongoing maintenance of the fire, reflecting the extended duration required for the bread to cook thoroughly."

The scene of the person sitting under a waterfall appears to be a separate moment, possibly indicating a break or a moment of relaxation during the cooking process. It does not serve as a metaphor for the passage of time related to the bread cooking."

The video shows the person preparing and cooking the bread in a natural outdoor setting, with various activities such as cutting ingredients, mixing dough, and cooking on a fire. The scene of the person bathing under a waterfall is simply another activity that takes place in the same natural environment, but it does not serve as a metaphor for the cooking process. The video focuses on the step-by-step preparation and cooking of the bread, with the waterfall scene being a separate element of the outdoor setting."

Here's how the banknote is folded:

1. **Fold the Banknote**: Start by folding the banknote in half lengthwise, creating a crease down the middle.
2. **Create a Slit**: Unfold the banknote and then fold it again, this time creating a small slit along the crease. The slit should be just wide enough for the pen to pass through.
3. **Re-fold the Banknote**: Carefully re-fold the banknote along the original crease, ensuring the slit aligns with the fold.
4. **Pass the Pen Through**: When you pass the pen through the slit, it will appear as if the pen is going through the entire banknote, but the note remains intact because the slit allows the pen to pass without tearing the paper.

This trick relies on the precise folding and the hidden slit, making it seem like the pen is passing through solid paper."

Here's how it works:

1. **Fold the Banknote**: The banknote is folded in such a way that it creates a small, narrow slot or channel. This is typically done by folding the note in half and then folding it again in a specific manner to create a tight crease.

2. **Position the Pen**: The pen is then carefully inserted into this narrow slot. The force applied is gentle and precise, ensuring that the pen slides through the folded part of the note rather than tearing it.

3. **Unfold the Banknote**: Once the pen is through, the banknote is unfolded, revealing that the pen has seemingly passed through the note without causing any damage.

The key to this trick is the precise folding and the careful insertion of the pen, which allows it to pass through the tightly folded section of the banknote."

Here's the explanation:

1. The diagram shows a right angle (90 degrees) divided into three angles: x, 2x, and 2x.
2. The sum of these angles must equal 90 degrees because they form a right angle.
3. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 2x + 2x = 90.
4. Simplifying the equation gives us 5x = 90.
5. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 5: x = 90 / 5 = 18.

0779-0,jt3v-FRTbrY,Primary Open-ended Question,Objective Causality,"What illusion is achieved in the video, and how?",19.62,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jt3v-FRTbrY,"The video demonstrates a visual illusion known as the Penrose Triangle, also referred to as an ""impossible triangle."" The object appears to be composed of nine separate cubes arranged in a triangular formation. However, when the object is rotated and viewed from different angles, it becomes clear that the structure is not possible in three-dimensional space. The illusion is achieved through the clever design of the object, which tricks the viewer's perception into seeing a coherent 3D shape that cannot exist in reality. The text in the video guides the viewer to observe the object from various perspectives, highlighting the impossibility of the structure and the resulting cognitive dissonance."
0779-1,jt3v-FRTbrY,Paraphrased Open-ended Question,Objective Causality,"How is the illusion in the video created, and what is it?",19.62,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jt3v-FRTbrY,"The illusion in the video is created using a 3D-printed object designed to mimic the Penrose triangle, a famous impossible object. The object appears to be composed of nine separate cubes arranged in a triangular formation, but when viewed from certain angles, it creates the illusion of an impossible structure that cannot exist in three-dimensional space.

Here's a brief explanation:

1. **Initial View**: The object initially looks like a set of nine cubes forming a triangular shape. This initial view is straightforward and seems logical.

2. **Rotation and Perspective Change**: As the object is rotated and viewed from different angles, the perspective changes reveal that the structure is not possible in reality. The edges and connections between the cubes appear to bend and twist in ways that defy the laws of geometry and physics.

3. **Impossible Structure**: The Penrose triangle is an optical illusion where the object appears to have a continuous loop of three straight beams meeting at right angles, which is geometrically impossible. The 3D-printed object in the video cleverly mimics this effect, making it seem as though the cubes are connected in an impossible way.

4. **Viewer Perception**: The video challenges viewers to see through the illusion by asking them to look closely and consider whether they can still perceive the individual cubes after understanding the trick. Most people will find it difficult to see the individual cubes once they realize the structure is impossible.

This illusion plays with our perception and understanding of three-dimensional space, creating a fascinating visual puzzle."
0779-2,jt3v-FRTbrY,Correctly-led Open-ended Question,Objective Causality,Does the video show a Penrose Triangle illusion created by arranging concave structures to appear as floating cubes?,19.62,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jt3v-FRTbrY,"Yes, the video shows a Penrose Triangle illusion created by arranging concave structures to appear as floating cubes. The orange object in the video is designed with concave sections that create an optical illusion, making it look like there are nine separate floating cubes forming a triangular shape. As the object is rotated and viewed from different angles, the illusion becomes more apparent, demonstrating how the concave structures interact with light and perspective to produce this visual effect."
0779-3,jt3v-FRTbrY,Wrongly-led Open-ended Question,Objective Causality,Is the illusion in the video achieved by aligning blocks to form a continuous triangle from a specific angle?,19.62,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jt3v-FRTbrY,"Yes, the illusion in the video is achieved by aligning blocks to form a continuous triangle from a specific angle. The object appears to be composed of nine separate square blocks arranged in a triangular formation when viewed from one angle. However, when the object is rotated or viewed from another angle, it becomes clear that the blocks are not actually connected in the way they initially appear, revealing the optical illusion."
0779-7,jt3v-FRTbrY,Multiple-choice Question with a Single Correct Answer,Objective Causality,"How is the Penrose Triangle illusion achieved in the video?
A. By constructing a 3D convex object that appears as floating cubes.

0790-0,HPoyer1Ix-o,Primary Open-ended Question,Professional Knowledge,How to adjust the transparent sheet to see the blue tube?,35.78,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HPoyer1Ix-o,"To see the blue tube, you need to rotate the transparent sheet 45 degrees. When the transparent sheet is rotated, it changes the way light passes through it, allowing the blue tube to become visible while the red and green tubes behind it appear blurred or invisible. This is due to the optical properties of the material used for the transparent sheet, which can manipulate light in specific ways depending on its orientation."
0790-1,HPoyer1Ix-o,Paraphrased Open-ended Question,Professional Knowledge,What adjustment is needed to make the blue tube visible through the transparent sheet?,35.78,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HPoyer1Ix-o,"To make the blue tube visible through the transparent sheet, you need to rotate the transparent sheet 45 degrees. This adjustment changes the orientation of the sheet relative to the tubes, allowing the blue tube to be seen clearly while the red and green tubes become less visible. The video demonstrates this by showing that when the sheet is rotated, the blue tube becomes fully visible, indicating a change in how light interacts with the sheet and the tubes."
0790-2,HPoyer1Ix-o,Correctly-led Open-ended Question,Professional Knowledge,"To see the blue tube, should the transparent sheet be rotated by 90 degrees?",35.78,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HPoyer1Ix-o,"No, the transparent sheet should not be rotated by 90 degrees to see the blue tube. According to the video, when the transparent sheet is placed over the tubes and then rotated 45 degrees, the blue tube becomes visible while the red and green tubes become invisible. This suggests that the specific angle of rotation (45 degrees) is what allows the blue tube to be seen clearly. Rotating it by 90 degrees would likely result in a different optical effect, potentially making the blue tube less visible or altering the visibility of the other tubes."
0790-3,HPoyer1Ix-o,Wrongly-led Open-ended Question,Professional Knowledge,"To see the blue tube, should the transparent sheet be rotated by 45 degrees?",35.78,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HPoyer1Ix-o,"No, the transparent sheet should not be rotated by 45 degrees to see the blue tube. The video demonstrates that when the transparent sheet is held in a certain orientation, it makes the blue tube appear and disappear due to an optical phenomenon. Rotating the sheet by 45 degrees would change the way light interacts with the sheet and the tubes, potentially altering the visibility of all the tubes rather than just revealing the blue one. The specific orientation needed to see the blue tube is shown in the video, and it does not involve a 45-degree rotation."
0790-7,HPoyer1Ix-o,Multiple-choice Question with a Single Correct Answer,Professional Knowledge,"How should the transparent sheet be adjusted to see the blue tube?

This is due to a visual illusion where the orientation of the object seems to flip when viewed from different angles. The structure's design tricks the eye into perceiving it as pointing in one direction when it is actually pointing in another."

This happens because the vibration from the tuning fork is transferred to the ball, causing it to vibrate and bounce. The text ""260 hz"" indicates the frequency of the vibration, which matches the natural frequency of the ball's bouncing motion, thus amplifying its movement."

When the man strikes the tuning fork the second time, it vibrates at 260 Hz, which is the same frequency as the first tuning fork. This causes the ball to start bouncing again due to the resonance effect. The video shows the ball bouncing in sync with the vibrations of the tuning fork, demonstrating the principle of resonance where objects vibrate more vigorously when excited by a force that matches their natural frequency."

Initially, the white, viscous substance was poured into the beaker. Then, using a rod, the substance was lifted out of the beaker. The person handling the rod stretched and manipulated the substance, causing it to elongate and form a long, stringy shape. This stretching action continued until the substance was completely transferred from the beaker to the rod, forming a large, elongated mass on the rod. The final step involved the person using their hands to further stretch and manipulate the substance, demonstrating its elastic properties."

The video shows that the rod was used to stir the liquid in the beaker, and as a result, some of the liquid adhered to the rod. When the rod was lifted out of the beaker, the liquid stretched and formed a long strand before breaking off and falling back into the beaker. This indicates that the liquid had a high viscosity and elasticity, which allowed it to stretch and adhere to the rod when it was lifted."

This is because the red ball was positioned at the end of the pendulum, and it had the longest string among the balls. When the old man swung his arm, the force was transferred through the strings, causing the red ball to swing the highest due to its position and the length of its string."

This is because it was positioned at the end of the line of balls, and as the old man's wide swing transferred energy through the other balls, the red ball at the far end received the cumulative force, causing it to move more than the others."

The video shows that despite the old man's large arm swing, the red ball remains relatively stationary compared to the other balls, which are affected more by the motion. This suggests that the red ball is either heavier or has a different mechanism that keeps it stable."

The video shows a series of balls suspended in the air, and when the old man swings his arm, the red ball on the far right is the one that moves significantly. This demonstrates the principle of action and reaction, where the force applied by the old man's arm causes the red ball to move, illustrating the concept of aligning actions with desired results."

The video shows a person walking along a ledge with water flowing over it, and the camera angle changes to show the person from a different perspective. The water appears to be flowing normally in both directions, indicating that there is no reverse video processing involved. The illusion of the waterfall flowing backwards is created by the change in camera angle and the reflection of the person in the water."

1233-0,vpzN7MFV4YU,Primary Open-ended Question,Objective Causality (Videography Phenomenon & Illusion),Why are there two reflections when there is only one person in the photo?,10.99,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vpzN7MFV4YU,"There are two reflections because the photo is a composite of two images. The first image shows the person kneeling on the ground with their reflection in a puddle. The second image captures the same person standing, and its reflection is also included. When these two images are combined, it creates the illusion of two reflections for one person."
1233-1,vpzN7MFV4YU,Paraphrased Open-ended Question,Objective Causality (Videography Phenomenon & Illusion),How come there are two reflections in the water when only one person is visible in the image?,10.99,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vpzN7MFV4YU,"There are not actually two reflections in the water. The image shows a single reflection of the person kneeling on the ground. The illusion of two reflections is created by the camera angle and the way the photo was taken. The photographer used a panoramic mode to capture the scene, which can sometimes result in distorted or repeated images when the camera moves along the line during the shot. This technique, combined with the reflective surface of the wet ground, gives the appearance of an additional reflection."
1233-2,vpzN7MFV4YU,Correctly-led Open-ended Question,Objective Causality (Videography Phenomenon & Illusion),Is the reason for the two reflections in the photo due to the use of a panoramic camera function that combined multiple images?,10.99,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vpzN7MFV4YU,"Yes, the two reflections in the photo are due to the use of a panoramic camera function. The panoramic mode combines multiple images into one wide-angle shot. In this case, the reflection on the wet ground was captured twice as the camera panned across the scene, creating an illusion of two separate reflections. This effect is enhanced by the angle and the way the light reflects off the water, making it appear as if there are two distinct reflections of the person."
1233-3,vpzN7MFV4YU,Wrongly-led Open-ended Question,Objective Causality (Videography Phenomenon & Illusion),Is the reason for the two reflections in the photo due to image synthesis technology?,10.99,Please state your answer with a brief explanation.,,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vpzN7MFV4YU,"No, the reason for the two reflections in the photo is not due to image synthesis technology. The reflections are created by the natural properties of water and light. In the video, a person is taking a photo of two individuals on a wet surface, likely after rain, which creates a reflective layer. The photographer then uses a panoramic mode on their phone to capture a wider view, including the reflection of the sky and surroundings in the water. This technique enhances the visual effect of the reflections without the need for digital manipulation."

Explanation: The pattern in the video suggests that the result of each equation is obtained by multiplying the two numbers and then adding the first number. For example:
- 2 + 2 = (2 * 2) + 2 = 6
- 3 + 3 = (3 * 3) + 3 = 12
- 4 + 5 = (4 * 5) + 4 = 24

Following this pattern, for 4 + 3:
- (4 * 3) + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16

However, the results given in the image do not follow this pattern. Instead, they seem to be arbitrary values. Therefore, based on the given values, the answer for 4 + 3 is 39."

Here's the pattern:

*   **2 + 2 = 24:**  The first number (2) is followed by the second number (2), then multiplied by 6. So, 22 * 6 = 132, but only the last two digits are shown: 24.
*   **3 + 3 = 36:**  The first number (3) is followed by the second number (3), then multiplied by 6. So, 33 * 6 = 198, but only the last two digits are shown: 36.
*   **4 + 5 = 59:** The first number (4) is followed by the second number (5), then multiplied by 6. So, 45 * 6 = 270, but only the last two digits are shown: 59.

Following this pattern, for **4 + 3**, we get 43 * 6 = 258, and the last two digits are **35**."

*   3 + 3 = (3 * 3) + 3 = 12
*   4 + 5 = (4 * 5) + 4 = 24

The pattern appears to be: (a + b) * a = result

- For 2 + 2 = 24: (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8 (but it's given as 24, which seems like an error)
- For 3 + 3 = 36: (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18 (but it's given as 36, another error)
- For 4 + 5 = 59: (4 + 5) * 4 = 9 * 4 = 36 (but it's given as 59, yet another error)

If we follow the pattern correctly, for 4 + 3:
(4 + 3) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28
